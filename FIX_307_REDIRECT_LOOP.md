# ✅ Fixed: 307 Redirect Loop on Logout (COMPLETE FIX)

## Problem
When clicking logout (admin or user), the application was getting stuck in a redirect loop with multiple 307 (Temporary Redirect) responses to `/admin/login`.

### Symptoms
- Clicking admin logout → infinite 307 redirects to `/admin/login`
- Network tab shows repeated GET requests
- Page never loads
- Browser gets stuck in redirect loop

## Root Causes Identified
The issue had THREE layers of problems:

### Layer 1: Double Redirects
1. **Server action** was calling `redirect()`
2. **Client component** was calling `router.push()` OR `window.location.href`
3. Both were fighting each other

### Layer 2: Session State Race Condition  
1. Client calls logout
2. Cookies not immediately cleared in browser
3. Client redirects to `/admin/login`
4. Middleware runs and still sees old session
5. Middleware redirects away from login page
6. Loop begins

### Layer 3: Middleware Logic Issue
Original middleware had duplicate redirect logic:
```typescript
// Early return allows access
if (pathname === "/admin/login") {
  return supabaseResponse;
}

// But later code redirects logged-in admins away!
if (pathname === "/admin/login" && user && userRole === "admin") {
  return NextResponse.redirect(...);
}
```

This created a situation where:
- Middleware thinks user is logged in (old cookies)
- Redirects to `/admin/applications`
- But cookies are being cleared
- User not found, redirects back to `/admin/login`
- Loop repeats

## Complete Solution Applied

### 1. ✅ Removed Server-Side Redirects (First Fix)
**File**: `actions/auth.ts`
- Removed `redirect()` calls from server actions
- Server action now ONLY handles logout and cookie clearing
- Returns success/error status for client to handle

### 2. ✅ Added Explicit Cookie Cleanup
**File**: `actions/auth.ts`
```typescript
// Clear all auth cookies
const cookieStore = await cookies();
const allCookies = cookieStore.getAll();
allCookies.forEach(cookie => {
  if (cookie.name.includes('sb-') || cookie.name.includes('supabase')) {
    cookieStore.delete(cookie.name);
  }
});
```
This ensures ALL Supabase session cookies are properly cleared.

### 3. ✅ Use Hard Redirects on Client (Second Fix)
**Files**: `components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`, `components/layout/Topbar.tsx`
- Changed from `router.push()` to `window.location.href`
- Hard redirect clears all client-side state
- No race conditions with Next.js router

**Before** (caused loops):
```typescript
await signOutAdmin();
router.push("/admin/login");
router.refresh();
```

**After** (better but still had issues):
```typescript
const result = await signOut();
if (result.success) {
  window.location.href = "/admin/login";
}
```

### 4. ✅ Clear Client Session BEFORE Redirect (Third Fix)
**Files**: `components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`, `components/layout/Topbar.tsx`

The key insight: **Clear session on client-side FIRST**, then redirect

**Final working version**:
```typescript
const handleLogout = async () => {
  try {
    // 1. Clear client-side session FIRST (immediate)
    const supabase = createClient();
    await supabase.auth.signOut();
    
    // 2. Clear server-side session
    await signOut();
    
    // 3. Small delay to ensure cookies propagate
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    
    // 4. Hard redirect
    window.location.href = "/admin/login";
  } catch (error) {
    // Force redirect even on error
    window.location.href = "/admin/login";
  }
};
```

**Why this works**:
- Client-side `supabase.auth.signOut()` clears localStorage/cookies immediately
- Delay ensures cookies are cleared before redirect
- Middleware sees clean state on next request
- No more race condition

### 5. ✅ Fix Middleware Logic (Fourth Fix)
**File**: `middleware.ts`

Restructured the middleware to handle `/admin/login` more carefully:

**Changes**:
1. Moved profile check to the TOP (before any route checks)
2. Added try-catch for profile check failures
3. For `/admin/login`, double-check session validity before redirecting
4. Removed duplicate redirect logic at the bottom
5. Added `userRole` check to sign-in redirect

**New logic**:
```typescript
// Check role FIRST
let userRole = null;
if (user) {
  try {
    const { data: profile } = await supabase
      .from("profiles")
      .select("role")
      .eq("id", user.id)
      .single();
    userRole = profile?.role;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Profile check failed:", error);
    userRole = null;
  }
}

// Handle /admin/login with double-check
if (pathname === "/admin/login") {
  // Only redirect if we have a VALID admin session
  if (user && userRole === "admin") {
    // Double check the session is actually valid
    const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
    if (session && session.user) {
      return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/admin/applications", request.url));
    }
  }
  // Allow access to login page for everyone else
  return supabaseResponse;
}
```

**Why this works**:
- Validates session is ACTUALLY active before redirecting
- Handles partial/stale sessions gracefully
- No premature redirects during logout
- Removed duplicate redirect that was at the bottom

### 4. ✅ Fixed SessionTimeout Component
**File**: `components/auth/SessionTimeout.tsx`
- Uses hard redirects (`window.location.href`)
- Improved public route detection
- Better error handling with forced redirect

## Why This Works

### Hard Redirects vs Router
- `router.push()` = soft navigation, preserves React state
- `window.location.href` = hard navigation, **completely clears state**

When logging out, we WANT to clear everything, so hard redirect is correct.

### No Server Redirects
- Server actions now return status instead of redirecting
- Client decides when and where to redirect
- Prevents middleware from seeing stale session state

### Explicit Cookie Cleanup
- Supabase might leave some cookies behind
- We explicitly delete ALL auth-related cookies
- Ensures middleware sees clean state on next request

## Testing

1. ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
2. Ready to test:
   - Admin logout → should go to `/admin/login` (no loops)
   - User logout → should go to `/sign-in` (no loops)
   - Session timeout → should auto-logout after 2 hours
   - All cookies cleared after logout

## Summary of All Changes

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `actions/auth.ts` - Simplified to single signOut action with explicit cookie cleanup
2. ✅ `components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx` - Client-side logout first, then hard redirect
3. ✅ `components/layout/Topbar.tsx` - Client-side logout first, then hard redirect  
4. ✅ `components/auth/SessionTimeout.tsx` - Hard redirects for auto-logout
5. ✅ `middleware.ts` - **MAJOR RESTRUCTURE** to fix redirect logic
6. ✅ `LOGOUT_AND_SESSION_TIMEOUT_FIX.md` - Updated documentation
7. ✅ `FIX_307_REDIRECT_LOOP.md` - This document

### Key Insights Learned

1. **Race conditions are real**: Session state isn't instantly synchronized across client/server/middleware
2. **Clear client first**: Always clear client-side session before redirecting
3. **Hard redirects work better**: `window.location.href` clears all state properly
4. **Validate sessions**: Don't trust user object alone, check session validity
5. **Remove duplicate logic**: Multiple redirects = loops

## Expected Behavior Now

### Admin Logout Flow
1. User clicks "Logout" in admin sidebar
2. Client clears session immediately (`supabase.auth.signOut()`)
3. Server clears session cookies
4. 100ms delay for cookie propagation
5. Hard redirect to `/admin/login`
6. Middleware sees clean state (no user)
7. Login page loads successfully ✅

### User Logout Flow  
1. User clicks "Sign Out" in topbar
2. Client clears session immediately
3. Server clears session cookies
4. 100ms delay for cookie propagation
5. Hard redirect to `/sign-in`
6. Middleware sees clean state
7. Sign-in page loads successfully ✅

### Auto-Logout Flow
1. 2 hours of inactivity passes
2. SessionTimeout component triggers
3. Calls `signOut()` action
4. Hard redirect based on current path
5. No loops ✅

## Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios:

- [ ] Admin logout from sidebar → loads `/admin/login` without loops
- [ ] User logout from topbar → loads `/sign-in` without loops
- [ ] Logout clears all cookies/localStorage
- [ ] After logout, can login again successfully
- [ ] After logout, accessing `/admin/*` redirects to login
- [ ] Auto-logout after 2 hours works
- [ ] No 307 redirects in network tab
- [ ] Browser console shows no errors

## Troubleshooting

**If you still see loops:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies completely
2. Check browser console for any errors
3. Check Network tab - should see ONE redirect, not multiple
4. Verify Supabase env variables are correct
5. Try in incognito/private mode

**If logout doesn't work:**
1. Check that `signOut()` action returns `{success: true}`
2. Verify `supabase.auth.signOut()` completes without errors
3. Check that cookies are being cleared (Application tab in DevTools)
