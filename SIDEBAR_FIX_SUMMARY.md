# Sidebar Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Component (`components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`)
- ✅ Separated Desktop and Mobile sidebar content into two distinct components
- ✅ Desktop sidebar uses `<aside>` with `hidden lg:flex` - always visible on desktop
- ✅ Mobile sidebar uses drawer overlay with backdrop
- ✅ Fixed localStorage hydration by checking `typeof window !== "undefined"`
- ✅ Changed `bg-brand` to `bg-primary` for theme consistency
- ✅ Added proper z-index layering (backdrop z-40, drawer z-50)
- ✅ Mobile drawer width increased to 72 (w-72) for better UX
- ✅ Added animations: `animate-in fade-in` for backdrop, `slide-in-from-left` for drawer

### 2. AppShell Component (`components/layout/AppShell.tsx`)
- ✅ Added auto-close mobile menu on window resize (>= 1024px)
- ✅ Fixed mobile header to use `bg-primary` instead of `bg-brand`
- ✅ Added semantic `<header>` tag for mobile header
- ✅ Added `aria-label` for accessibility
- ✅ Added `w-full` to main content container

### 3. Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile (< 1024px)**: 
  - Sidebar hidden by default
  - Hamburger menu in top header
  - Drawer slides in from left when opened
  - Backdrop closes drawer on click
- **Desktop (>= 1024px)**:
  - Sidebar always visible
  - Can collapse to icon-only mode (w-16)
  - Collapse state persists in localStorage

### 4. Key Features
- ✅ Smooth animations for drawer
- ✅ Proper z-index stacking
- ✅ Accessibility (aria-label, semantic HTML)
- ✅ Touch-friendly mobile drawer (w-72)
- ✅ Auto-close on navigation
- ✅ Auto-close on resize to desktop
- ✅ Theme-aware colors (uses CSS variables)
