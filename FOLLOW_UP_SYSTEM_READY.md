## 🎯 How It Works

### Auto-Create Process
1. User adds new application in Tracker
2. System automatically creates 3 reminders:
   - **Day 3**: First follow-up
   - **Day 7**: Second follow-up
   - **Day 14**: Final follow-up
3. Reminders skip weekends (Saturday → Monday, Sunday → Monday)
4. Status: `pending` initially

### Smart Status Handling
**When status changes to "Interview":**
- Old reminders → cancelled
- New reminders created:
  - Pre-interview (1 day before)
  - Thank you note (same day after interview)
  - Post-interview follow-up (3 days after)

**When status changes to "Rejected/Hired/Withdrawn":**
- All pending reminders → cancelled

### User Workflow
1. **View reminders** in `/tools/tracker/followups`
2. **Check stats** - see overdue, due this week, completed
3. **Filter by tab** - Due Now, Upcoming, Completed, All
4. **Take action:**
   - Click "Follow-up Now" → Opens template selector
   - Choose channel: Email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Phone
   - Select template (pre-filled with variables)
   - Copy message and send
   - Mark as "Sent" → Logs to history
5. **Or snooze/dismiss** if not ready

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **Template variables** - Some fields like `hrd_name`, `hrd_email` not in applications table
   - **Workaround**: User manually edits template before sending
   - **Fix**: Add these fields to applications table in future

2. **Actual sending** - "Follow-up Now" only opens template, doesn't send
   - **Workaround**: User copies and sends manually
   - **Fix**: Add email/WhatsApp integration

3. **History tracking** - `follow_up_history` table exists but not fully used
   - **Workaround**: Basic logging works
   - **Fix**: Expand history tracking in Phase 2

### Limitations
- No email/WhatsApp automation (manual send)
- No real-time notifications
- No calendar integration
- Response tracking is manual
