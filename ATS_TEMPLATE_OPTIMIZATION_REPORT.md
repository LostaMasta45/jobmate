# ATS Templates Optimization Report

## Overview
All 8 ATS templates have been refactored to implement best practices for typography, visual hierarchy, and spacing. These changes ensure the CVs are not only machine-readable (ATS friendly) but also highly readable for human recruiters.

## Key Improvements Applied

### 1. Typography
- **Serif Templates (Classic, Elegant):** Switched to `"Charter", "Bitstream Charter", "Sitka Text", Cambria, serif` and Georgia stacks for better screen/print readability.
- **Sans Templates (Modern, Minimalist, Corporate, Executive):** Upgraded to `"Inter", "Roboto", "Helvetica Neue", Arial` and `"Calibri", "Roboto"` for a modern, clean look.
- **Monospace (Functional):** Used `"JetBrains Mono", "Fira Code"` for a premium technical feel.

### 2. Visual Hierarchy
- **Names:** Increased font size (up to 28pt) and weight (Bold/ExtraBold) to make the candidate's name the clear focal point.
- **Section Headers:** Standardized uppercase, bold tracking (letter-spacing), and bottom borders to clearly delineate sections.
- **Roles vs Companies:** Distinct styles for Job Title (Larger, Bold, Darker) vs Company Name (Medium, Semi-bold, Lighter/Uppercase).
- **Dates:** Consistently aligned to the right or styled distinctly to allow for quick timeline scanning.

### 3. Spacing & Layout
- **Line Height:** Increased from `1.2-1.4` to `1.5-1.6` across the board. This "whitespace" drastically reduces cognitive load for readers.
- **Lists:** Added proper vertical spacing (`space-y-1.5`) between bullet points and consistent left padding/margins.
- **Margins:** Adjusted container padding to balance content density with breathing room (generally `20mm`, reduced to `15mm` for Executive to fit more content).

## Template Specifics

| Template | Category | Key Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Classic** | Serif | Charter font, clearer contact separators, cleaner list bullets. |
| **Modern** | Sans | Inter font, heavy bold name, clean slate-900 headers. |
| **Elegant** | Serif | Georgia font, double-border accents, increased line-height for luxury feel. |
| **Minimalist** | Sans | Verdana font, improved "sidebar" alignment for headers, clean timeline. |
| **Corporate** | Dense | Roboto font, improved sidebar background separation visually (via whitespace). |
| **Executive** | Dense | Calibri font, denser layout (15mm margin), grid competencies. |
| **Functional** | Mono | JetBrains Mono headers, Inter body text for readability, dashed lines. |
| **Sidebar** | Creative | Trebuchet MS, stronger visual weight on the left sidebar, improved timeline dots. |

These templates are now production-ready and optimized for the 2024/2025 job market standards.
