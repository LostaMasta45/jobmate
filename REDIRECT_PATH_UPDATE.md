# ✅ UPDATE: Redirect Path Changes

## 🔄 Changes Made

### Before:
- VIP Basic blocked from tools → `/vip/loker`
- Free users → `/vip/loker`

### After:
- VIP Basic blocked from tools → `/vip` ✅
- VIP Premium blocked from tools → N/A (shouldn't happen, they have access)
- Free users → `/vip` ✅

## 🎯 New Routing Logic

### VIP Basic Users:
```
Login → membership = 'vip_basic'
  ↓
Try /dashboard → ❌ Redirect to /vip
Try /tools/** → ❌ Redirect to /vip
Try /vip → ✅ Access granted (VIP Career home)
Try /vip/loker → ✅ Access granted
Try /vip/perusahaan → ✅ Access granted
```

### VIP Premium Users:
```
Login → membership = 'vip_premium'
  ↓
Try /dashboard → ✅ Access granted
Try /tools/** → ✅ Access granted
Try /vip → ✅ Access granted (VIP Career home)
Try /vip/loker → ✅ Access granted
Try /vip/perusahaan → ✅ Access granted
```

### Free Users:
```
Login → membership = 'free'
  ↓
Try /dashboard → ❌ Redirect to /vip
Try /tools/** → ❌ Redirect to /vip
Try /vip → ❌ Redirect to /sign-in?message=vip_required
```

## 📋 Middleware Changes

**File**: `middleware.ts`

```typescript
// VIP Basic blocked from JobMate tools
if (membership === 'vip_basic') {
  console.log('[MIDDLEWARE] VIP Basic user blocked from JobMate tools, redirecting to VIP home');
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/vip?message=premium_only", request.url));
}

// Free users
console.log('[MIDDLEWARE] Non-member trying to access JobMate');
return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/vip?message=premium_required", request.url));
```

## 🎨 Expected User Experience

### VIP Basic User Journey:
1. Login successfully ✅

## 📊 URL Matrix

| Path | Free | VIP Basic | VIP Premium |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `/vip` | ❌ → sign-in | ✅ HOME | ✅ HOME |
| `/vip/loker` | ❌ → sign-in | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/vip/perusahaan` | ❌ → sign-in | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/dashboard` | ❌ → /vip | ❌ → /vip | ✅ |
| `/tools/**` | ❌ → /vip | ❌ → /vip | ✅ |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test VIP Basic:
1. Login as VIP Basic user
2. Try to go to `/dashboard`
3. Should redirect to `/vip` ✅
4. URL should be: `http://localhost:3001/vip?message=premium_only`
5. Can navigate to `/vip/loker` manually ✅

### Test VIP Premium:
1. Login as VIP Premium user
2. Can access `/dashboard` ✅
3. Can access `/tools/cv-ats` ✅
4. Can access `/vip` ✅
5. Full access everywhere ✅

### Console Logs:
**VIP Basic trying /dashboard:**
```
[MIDDLEWARE] User: user@example.com
[MIDDLEWARE] Membership: vip_basic
[MIDDLEWARE] Path: /dashboard
[MIDDLEWARE] VIP Basic user blocked from JobMate tools, redirecting to VIP home
```

**VIP Premium accessing /tools:**
```
[MIDDLEWARE] User: user@example.com
[MIDDLEWARE] Membership: vip_premium
[MIDDLEWARE] Path: /tools/cv-ats
[MIDDLEWARE] VIP Premium access granted to JobMate
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Cleaner UX**: VIP Basic users land on `/vip` homepage instead of directly to loker
2. **Better onboarding**: Can show welcome message or navigation at `/vip`
3. **Upgrade prompts**: Easier to show upgrade to Premium at `/vip` page
4. **Consistent routing**: All users start at `/vip` home, then navigate

## 📝 Notes

- `/vip` should have a good landing page for VIP users
- Show different content for Basic vs Premium at `/vip`
- Add upgrade CTA for VIP Basic users at `/vip` page
- Breadcrumb navigation helps users understand where they are
