# ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY CHECKLIST

## üéØ Pre-Deployment Verification

### Database ‚úÖ
- [x] Legacy columns removed (`membership_tier`, `membership_expires_at`)
- [x] RLS policies working (simple, no circular dependency)
- [x] All existing users have correct profile IDs
- [x] Constraints added on membership columns
- [x] Test queries work for authenticated users

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase:
-- 1. Check no legacy columns
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' 
AND column_name IN ('membership_tier', 'membership_expires_at');
-- Should return 0 rows

-- 2. Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
-- Should show: authenticated_users_read_all, users_update_own, users_insert_own

-- 3. Check all users have matching IDs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users au ON au.email = p.email
WHERE p.id != au.id;
-- Should return 0
```

### Backend Code ‚úÖ
- [x] Admin member update uses new columns only
- [x] Approval flow creates profile with correct ID
- [x] No references to legacy columns in code
- [x] Error handling improved
- [x] Service role client used for admin operations

**Verify:**
```bash
# Search for any legacy column references
grep -r "membership_tier" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
grep -r "membership_expires_at" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
# Should return 0 matches (except in .md files)
```

### Application Flow ‚úÖ
- [x] New user registration works
- [x] Admin approval creates valid profile
- [x] Admin can upgrade membership
- [x] Users can login after membership change
- [x] Middleware correctly reads membership
- [x] Access control works (VIP/Premium routes)

**Test:**
1. Register new user via /ajukan-akun
2. Admin approve via /admin/applications
3. User login ‚Üí Should work
4. Admin upgrade to VIP Basic
5. User logout ‚Üí login ‚Üí Can access /vip
6. Admin upgrade to VIP Premium
7. User logout ‚Üí login ‚Üí Can access /dashboard + /tools

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Database
```sql
-- Create backup of profiles table
CREATE TABLE profiles_backup_20250118 AS
SELECT * FROM profiles;

-- Verify backup
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles_backup_20250118;
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migrations
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run in order:
1. db/COMPLETE_FIX_WORKFLOW.sql  (if not already run)
2. db/FIX_RLS_SIMPLE.sql         (required!)
```

### Step 3: Deploy Backend Code
```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
# Deploy to your hosting (Vercel, etc.)
```

### Step 4: Notify All Active Users
```
Subject: System Update - Please Re-Login

Hi [Name],

We've updated our system. Please:
1. Logout dari aplikasi
2. Login kembali

Your membership status tetap sama, hanya perlu refresh session.

Terima kasih!
```

### Step 5: Monitor Initial Period
- Watch middleware logs for "undefined" errors
- Check Sentry/error tracking for issues
- Be ready to run individual user fixes if needed

---

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Immediate (First Hour):
- [ ] Test login with 3-5 different users
- [ ] Verify middleware logs show correct membership
- [ ] Test VIP route access
- [ ] Test membership upgrade flow
- [ ] Check no errors in Sentry

### First Day:
- [ ] Monitor user complaints
- [ ] Check database for any ID mismatches
- [ ] Verify no undefined in logs
- [ ] Test admin operations

### First Week:
- [ ] All users can access their features
- [ ] No manual SQL fixes needed for new users
- [ ] Approval flow working smoothly
- [ ] Membership upgrades processed correctly

---

## üÜò Emergency Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur:

### Option 1: Disable RLS Temporarily
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- Test if issues resolve
-- If yes, problem is RLS policy
-- Run FIX_RLS_SIMPLE.sql again
```

### Option 2: Restore from Backup
```sql
-- If database corrupted
TRUNCATE profiles;
INSERT INTO profiles SELECT * FROM profiles_backup_20250118;
```

### Option 3: Individual User Fix
```sql
-- For specific broken user
-- Use NUCLEAR_FIX template
-- Replace email and run
```

---

## üìã Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: User Shows "undefined" After Login
**Cause:** Profile ID doesn't match auth.users ID  
**Fix:**
```sql
-- Run for affected user
-- See db/NUCLEAR_FIX_TESTBASIC.sql template
```

### Issue 2: User Must Login 2x
**Cause:** Session transition, old token still cached  
**Workaround:** Normal behavior, second login works  
**Prevention:** Tell user to logout first before login after membership change

### Issue 3: Admin Can't See All Members
**Cause:** Admin operations use regular auth, not service role  
**Fix:** Admin operations already use `createAdminClient()` which bypasses RLS

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

### All must be TRUE:
- ‚úÖ 95%+ users can login without manual intervention
- ‚úÖ No "undefined" errors in middleware logs
- ‚úÖ Membership upgrades work within 5 minutes (after logout/login)
- ‚úÖ New registrations work end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard shows correct data
- ‚úÖ No database ID mismatches
- ‚úÖ RLS policies allow normal operations

---

## üìû Support Quick Reference

### For Support Team:

**User can't login (shows undefined):**
```
1. Ask user to logout completely
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Close browser
4. Open fresh and login
5. If still fails ‚Üí Escalate to dev team
```

**User upgraded but can't access VIP:**
```
1. Verify upgrade in admin dashboard
2. Ask user to LOGOUT
3. Clear cache
4. LOGIN again
5. Should work now
```

**Urgent fix needed:**
```
Contact: [dev team]
Provide: User email, error message, middleware logs
Dev will run SQL fix directly
```

## üîê Security Notes

### RLS Policy Permissive by Design:
- All authenticated users can READ all profiles
- This is OK for internal app
- Prevents circular dependency issues
- Admin operations use service role (bypasses RLS anyway)

### If Need Stricter Security Later:
```sql
-- Option: Only allow users to read own + admin
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_users_read_limited"
ON profiles FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  auth.uid() = id 
  OR 
  auth.jwt() -> 'app_metadata' ->> 'role' = 'admin'
);
-- Use JWT metadata instead of subquery to avoid circular dependency
```

---

## üìù Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly:
```sql
-- Check for ID mismatches
SELECT email, 'ID Mismatch' as issue
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users au ON au.email = p.email
WHERE p.id != au.id;
```

### Monthly:
```sql
-- Check for orphaned profiles
SELECT p.email, 'No auth user' as issue
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN auth.users au ON au.id = p.id
WHERE au.id IS NULL;

-- Check for users without profiles
SELECT au.email, 'No profile' as issue
FROM auth.users au
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.id = au.id
WHERE p.id IS NULL;
```
